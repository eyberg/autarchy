looks like we can use the firefox proxy dynamically now...
we'll need to open/close it anytime we change it though.... that kinda blows
but oh well..

should be a way to specify the host/proxy for chrome...
  either through:       --proxy-server=host:port

seocracy...

or:
  environment of        http_proxy

or ..

def works: (how to pass it in though?)
  google-chrome --proxy-server=41.190.16.17:8080

try requestign pages through a local proxy....

also.. copy the google-chrome bash over the symlink.
PROXY=41.190.16.17:8080

can try specifying firefox path via:
-firefoxProfileTemplate "path to the profile"
